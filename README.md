# Dayastark Chat App
Here, I haved developed a real-time chat application using SignalR, Bootstrap, and jQuery Modal Popup. There is a Login system for existing users and registration for new users with ASP.NET Identity. First, the user has to create an account with Username, name and password and then they can login by using their login credentials, so the login authentications are required. After login, a user will be search friends and then sent to them friend requests. whenever friend will be accepted request, then they will  participate in chat or discussion. The users can change their display picture after logging in the application.

  - New Users can search, view, check details and personal chat with friends.
  - Change Profile, change password and name. 
  - Sent Friend Request, Accept Request, real time message, real time online.
